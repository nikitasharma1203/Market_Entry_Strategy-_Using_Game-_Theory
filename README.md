# Market Entry Strategy Using Game Theory & Product Analytics

## A Data-Driven Decision Framework for Competitive Platform Launch

### Project Overview

This project analyzes a real-world NYC Taxi dataset to design a market entry strategy for a second ride-hailing platform (Platform B) entering a market already dominated by an incumbent (Platform A).

By combining data analytics, product management frameworks, and game theory, the project demonstrates how pricing, subsidies, and timing decisions impact demand capture, profitability, and strategic stability.

The final output is an interactive Streamlit dashboard that allows decision-makers to simulate competitive strategies in real time.

### Problem Statement

How should a new platform enter a competitive urban mobility market to maximize adoption and profitability without triggering destructive price wars?

### Concepts Applied

**Data Analytics**

Exploratory analysis of NYC Taxi demand & pricing

Hourly demand patterns

Fare benchmarking

Elasticity-based demand modeling

**Game Theory**

Prisoner’s Dilemma (price wars)

Nash Equilibrium (stable pricing strategies)

Dominated strategies (loss-making discounts)

Strategic retaliation risk

**Product Management**

Product lifecycle strategy (Introduction → Growth → Maturity)

Pricing & promotion (4Ps)

Subsidy optimization

Customer acquisition vs retention trade-offs

### Tech Stack

Python

Pandas / NumPy

Matplotlib

Streamlit

NYC Open Data


### Dashboard Features

Dynamic pricing & subsidy sliders

Demand capture simulation

Profit optimization curves

Game-theoretic strategy warnings

Product lifecycle recommendations

### Key Insights

Aggressive discounts increase demand but often destroy profitability

Nash-stable strategies exist at moderate discounts

Off-peak entry reduces retaliation risk

Subsidies should be temporary and data-driven


*This project shows how data-driven strategy + game theory can guide real-world product and pricing decisions in competitive markets.*
